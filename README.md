# Neural-Networks-Deep-Learning
The project was accomplished by delivering 2 sub-projects. Part 1 deploys a neural network to build a regressor &amp; classifier respectively for a communications equipment manufacturer.  Part 2 delivers an image classifier, which can classify numbers from the photographs captured at street level using a Neural Network‚Äù
